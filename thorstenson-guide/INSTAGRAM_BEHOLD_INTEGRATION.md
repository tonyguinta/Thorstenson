# Instagram Behold Integration: Phased Implementation Plan

## **Overview**
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for Instagram feed integration using Behold.so Personal tier, broken into 6 bite-sized phases with clear success criteria and approval gates.

## **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: READY TO BEGIN**
**Estimated Completion**: 2-3 weeks  
**Implementation approach**: 6 phases with user verification at each gate

## **Implementation Rules**
- ‚úÖ **Stop at the end of each phase** to verify success criteria
- ‚úÖ **Get positive affirmation** before proceeding to next phase
- ‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** at each phase boundary
- ‚úÖ **COMMIT ONLY AFTER USER VERIFICATION** - Never commit untested code
- ‚úÖ **Ask for approval** - err on the side of too much rather than too little

## **Commit & Push Protocol**
1. **Code & Request Testing**: Complete implementation work and ask user to test/verify
2. **User Testing**: User tests functionality and reports results
3. **Commit After Verification**: Only commit once user confirms implementation works
4. **Push When Ordered**: Only push to staging/production when explicitly requested

**CRITICAL**: Never commit code that hasn't been user-tested. Keep commit history clean with verified, working implementations only.
