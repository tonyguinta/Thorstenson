      questions: [
        {
          question: "How far in advance should I book?",
          answer: "We recommend booking 2-4 weeks in advance, especially during peak season (June-August). However, we sometimes have last-minute availability, so don't hesitate to call even for short notice trips."
        },
        {
          question: "What's included in the price?",
          answer: "All trips include professional guide service, high-quality fishing equipment, tackle, bait, safety equipment, and fish cleaning. Full-day trips also include shore lunch and cooler with ice. See our Services page for detailed inclusions."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to pay a deposit?",
          answer: "Yes, we require a 50% deposit to secure your booking. The remaining balance is due on the day of your trip. We accept cash, check, or card payments."
        },
        {
          question: "What's your cancellation policy?",
          answer: "We offer full refunds for cancellations made 72 hours or more before your trip. Weather-related cancellations (determined by the guide for safety) are fully refundable or can be rescheduled."

      category: "What to Expect",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "What should I bring?",
          answer: "Bring a valid Minnesota fishing license, weather-appropriate clothing, sunglasses, sunscreen, camera, and snacks/drinks. We provide all fishing equipment. A cooler for your fish is optional - we can provide one if needed."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you provide equipment for beginners?",
          answer: "Absolutely! We provide all fishing equipment including rods, reels, tackle, and bait. James will teach you proper techniques and help you throughout the trip. No prior experience necessary."
        },
        {
          question: "What if the weather is bad?",
          answer: "Safety is our top priority. If conditions are unsafe, we'll contact you 24 hours before (or morning of) to reschedule or provide a full refund. Light rain usually doesn't stop us - fish often bite better in overcast conditions!"
        },
        {
          question: "How many people can go on one trip?",
          answer: "We limit trips to a maximum of 2 people for safety and to ensure a quality experience. Additional people can be accommodated for an extra $100/day. Children under 12 receive a 50% discount."

      category: "Fishing Details",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "What types of fish can we catch?",
          answer: "Ely's waters are home to walleye, northern pike, bass (largemouth and smallmouth), lake trout, and various panfish. Species availability depends on season, location, and conditions. James will target species based on your preferences and current conditions."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the best time of year to fish?",
          answer: "Open water season runs May through October. June-August is peak season with warmest weather. May and September offer excellent fishing with fewer crowds. We also offer ice fishing December through March for a unique winter experience."
        },
        {
          question: "Can we keep the fish we catch?",
          answer: "Yes! We follow Minnesota fishing regulations and practice sustainable fishing. James will help you understand limits and select the best fish to keep. We provide basic fish cleaning, and full cleaning/packaging is available."
        },
        {
          question: "What if we don't catch anything?",
          answer: "While we can't guarantee fish (that's why it's called fishing, not catching!), James's local knowledge and 38+ years of experience give you the best possible chance. We focus on the complete experience - enjoying nature, learning techniques, and having fun on the water."

      category: "Logistics",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Where do we meet?",

        },
        {
          question: "Do you provide transportation?",
          answer: "Transportation to the boat launch is not included - you'll need to meet us there. However, we provide the boat, motor, fuel, and all on-water transportation during your trip."
        },
        {
          question: "What about lunch on full-day trips?",
          answer: "Full-day trips include a traditional shore lunch where we prepare your fresh-caught fish over an open fire, along with sides. It's a highlight of the experience! We can accommodate dietary restrictions with advance notice."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there bathroom facilities?",
          answer: "Most launch sites have basic facilities. During the trip, we're in wilderness areas where facilities aren't available. James will brief you on what to expect and provide guidance for longer trips."

        },
        {
          question: "What about people with mobility issues?",

          question: "Do you offer gift certificates?",
          answer: "Yes! Fishing trips make great gifts for birthdays, holidays, or special occasions. Contact us to arrange gift certificates. They're valid for one year from purchase date."
        },
        {
          question: "Can we bring alcohol?",
          answer: "We don't permit alcohol during fishing trips for safety reasons. However, we're happy to celebrate your catches with photos and stories! Non-alcoholic beverages are encouraged."
