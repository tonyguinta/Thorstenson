- Apply markup and tax to trip charges like other costs

**Advanced Features (Future Phase):**
- GPS/distance-based calculation
- Integration with project scheduling
- Different rates for different service types

**Questions to Answer Before Implementation:**
- Should trip charges be per-project or per-invoice?
- How do trip charges interact with markup and tax calculation order?
- What are common contractor patterns for trip charge billing?

## **Technical Architecture Decisions**

### **Database Schema Strategy**
**RESOLVED - Compromise Approach:**
- **Current Phase**: Maintain single-file structure for `models.py` and `schemas.py`
- **Post-Estimate Milestone**: Plan deliberate refactor after core financial features complete
- **Rationale**: Avoid premature optimization while acknowledging future complexity will require cleanup

**Implementation Plan:**
- Continue with current structure through sales tax, markup, and estimate features
- Create cleanup milestone once financial feature complexity grows
- Domain-based separation: `user.py`, `project.py`, `invoice.py`, `estimate.py`

### **PDF Generation Strategy**
**RESOLVED - Server-side Approach:**
- **Recommended**: `WeasyPrint` (excellent CSS support) or `pdfkit` (HTML-based)
- **Rationale**: Server-side generation for legally-sensitive documents provides better control and consistency
- **Future Consideration**: Third-party services (Docmosis, PDFMonkey) if layout complexity grows significantly

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Full control over PDF rendering
- Consistent output across environments  
- Better security for sensitive financial documents
- Professional layout capabilities with CSS

- ‚úÖ NUMERIC(6,6) precision for full tax rate support
- ‚úÖ Real-time calculations across all subproject changes
- ‚úÖ Production deployment and testing complete

### **Markup System Implementation:**

- [ ] Design markup audit trail if needed
- [ ] Plan integration with existing cost calculations
- [ ] Update feature numbering after sales tax completion

### **Estimate Generation Implementation:**
- [ ] Choose PDF generation approach
- [ ] Design client access method (portal vs anonymous)
- [ ] Research electronic signature compliance requirements
- [ ] Plan estimate versioning data structure

### **Change Order System Implementation:**
- [ ] Design approval workflow state machine
- [ ] Plan change diff calculation approach
- [ ] Determine client interaction capabilities

## **Audit Trail & Event Logging**

### **Financial Event Tracking**
Track every major financial or legal change with complete audit trail:

```json
{
  "event": "estimate_revision",
  "user": "tony",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "entity_type": "project", 
  "entity_id": 123,
  "old": { "labor": 5000 },
  "new": { "labor": 6000 },
  "note": "Plumber cost updated after bid",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"
}
```

### **Estimate Lifecycle Events**
**Required State Transitions:**
- `draft` ‚Üí `sent` ‚Üí `viewed` ‚Üí `signed` ‚Üí `locked`
- Each transition logged with timestamp, user, and context
- Complete traceability for disputes or compliance audits

### **Event Types to Track:**
- Estimate creation, revision, sending, viewing, signing
- Change order creation and approval  
- Markup modifications
- Tax rate changes
- Payment status updates
- Project status changes

## **Compliance & Legal Considerations**

### **Electronic Signatures:**
**Phased Compliance Approach:**
1. **Phase 1**: Draw-to-sign + timestamp (simple, familiar UX)
2. **Phase 2**: Typed name + checkbox + IP logging (legally sufficient for most states)
3. **Phase 3**: Third-party integration (DocuSign/HelloSign for full compliance)

**Research Requirements:**
- Construction industry signature requirements by state
- Audit trail and verification standards
- Binding vs non-binding estimate classification

### **Data Retention:**
- Signed estimate storage requirements
- Change order documentation retention
- Legal compliance for financial records

### **Disclaimers Required:**
- Legal boilerplate templates are for convenience only
- Tax calculations may require professional review
- Electronic signatures compliance with local laws
- Warranty and liability limitations

- Accurate tax calculations on all estimates/invoices
- Easy per-project tax rate override
- Clear tax breakdown display

### **Markup System:**
- Markup never visible to clients
- Accurate profit margin calculations
- Easy markup configuration per project

### **Estimate Generation:**
- Professional PDF estimates
- Successful signature capture
- Locked estimate integrity

### **Change Orders:**

- Clear approval workflow
- Client-visible change history

## **Key Questions Requiring Clarification**

### **Critical Legal/Business Questions:**
1. ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Estimate Legal Status**: Formal "offer" that becomes binding upon signature with user-configurable legal stance and disclaimers

2. **What are common contractor patterns for trip charge billing?**
   - Per-project vs per-invoice
   - Distance-based vs flat fee preferences  
   - Integration with existing cost structures

3. **Should markup be per-category (Materials/Labor separate) or project-wide?**
   - Affects database design and calculation complexity
   - Impacts contractor workflow and profitability tracking

### **Technical Implementation Questions:**
1. **How granular should estimate cost breakdowns be?**
   - Category totals only vs detailed line items
   - Client-facing transparency vs internal detail

2. **What happens when estimates expire?**
   - Automatic status changes, notifications
   - Re-approval workflow requirements

### **‚úÖ Ready to Implement:**
1. **Sales Tax System** - All decisions made, ready to begin
2. **Trip Charges (MVP)** - Manual entry approach confirmed
3. **PDF Generation** - Server-side WeasyPrint approach locked in  
4. **E-Signature (Phase 1)** - Draw-to-sign canvas for MVP

### **üü° Needs Final Decisions:**
1. **Markup System** - Per-category vs project-wide structure
2. **Estimate Breakdowns** - Granularity level for client-facing documents

### **üî¥ Requires Research:**
1. **Trip Charge Patterns** - Industry billing practices
2. **Estimate Expiration** - Workflow and notification requirements
