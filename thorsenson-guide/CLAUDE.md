# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a fishing guide website for James ("Jamie") Thorstenson's business in Ely, MN. The project is currently in the planning/design phase with the following tech stack:

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Backend (if needed):** FastAPI or serverless API routes
- **Database (if needed):** PostgreSQL on Railway
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe
- **Third-Party Services:** Elfsight (Instagram feed), Facebook Page Plugin

## Key Features to Implement

- Homepage with intro, CTA buttons, and social proof
- About page for James, Brittney, and team members
- Booking calendar with availability management and payments
- Trips & Services overview with pricing and policies
- Social media feed page (Adventure Log)
- Photo Gallery with optional client submissions
- FAQ and Contact pages

## Development Guidelines

- Use mobile-first responsive design
- Implement SEO optimization
- Use environment variables for API keys (Stripe, social media embeds)
- Deploy preview environments via Vercel for feedback
- Focus on performance and user experience

## Open Decisions

- Combined site (contracting + guiding) vs. two separate sites
- Custom booking scheduler vs. third-party solution (Calendly)
- Final branding name (current idea: Tiller Bros, but local advice suggests including "Ely" or something Ely is known for)

## Recommendations

- **Start with guide business first** - Focus on new business that needs marketing push, add contracting section later
- **Custom scheduler preferred** - More control, better integration, professional look for premium service
- **Single site approach** - Two audiences likely overlap in Ely area, easier to manage, better SEO
- **Ely/BWCA branding** - Consider "Boundary Waters" or "BWCA" related names based on local advice
- **Mobile-first critical** - Fishing clients will book on phones while planning trips
- **Focus on storytelling** - Jamie's authenticity/lifestyle is key differentiator in crowded guide market

## Business Model Considerations

- Pricing strategy (half-day/full-day/multi-day trips)
- Capacity planning (simultaneous client limits)
- Weather contingency policies
- Equipment provided vs. client responsibility
- Seasonal business content strategy
- Fishing guide insurance/liability requirements
- Competition differentiation strategy

## Photo Analysis & Placement Strategy

### Available Photos
- **Big Sis.png** - Family photo by the lake (Jamie, Brittney, Ella) â†’ Hero section or About page

### Color Scheme
Based on northern Minnesota wilderness and lake photos:
- **Deep lake blues**: #1E3A8A, #3B82F6
- **Forest greens**: #065F46, #10B981
- **Warm earth tones**: #92400E, #F59E0B
- **Clean whites/grays**: #F8FAFC, #64748B for contrast
