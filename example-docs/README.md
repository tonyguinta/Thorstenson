## Development Guidelines

This project follows AI-driven development practices documented in `CLAUDE.md`:

### Core Development Principles
- **6-Phase Implementation Pattern**: Break complex features into manageable phases with approval gates
- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Strategic planning (FEATURE_PLANNING.md) and implementation guides
- **Testing-First Approach**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- **Commit Discipline**: Only commit user-verified, working code
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Proactive issue management in TECHNICAL_DEBT.md

### Two-Tier Work Tracking System
- **Tier 1: Strategic Documentation** (FEATURE_PLANNING.md) - Business requirements and major features
- **Tier 2: Active Sprint Work** (TodoWrite tool) - Current implementation tasks and progress tracking

### Quality Assurance Protocol
- **Testing Requirements**: All new code must include unit tests
- **Approval Gates**: Each development phase requires user verification before proceeding
- **Clean Commit History**: Only verified, working implementations are committed

### Code Standards
- **Architecture**: Clear separation between frontend/backend layers
- **Backend Style**: FastAPI with Pydantic validation and SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend Style**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and BuildCraftPro design system
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication flow
- **Data Modeling**: Consistent database patterns with proper relationships
- **Naming**: Consistent naming conventions across the stack
- **Branding**: Professional construction industry aesthetic with consistent color usage

### Design System Usage

The BuildCraftPro design system includes:

```css
/* Primary Actions */
.btn-primary      /* Navy Blueprint background */
.btn-accent       /* Construction Amber background */
.btn-secondary    /* Neutral gray background */

/* Outline Variants */
.btn-outline-primary  /* Navy Blueprint border */
.btn-outline-accent   /* Construction Amber border */

/* Color Utilities */
.text-primary     /* Navy Blueprint text */
.text-accent      /* Construction Amber text */
.text-success     /* Builder Green text */
.text-warning     /* Jobsite Yellow text */
.text-error       /* Safety Red text */
```

## API Documentation

When running the backend server, visit http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation powered by FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation.

### API Authentication

The API uses JWT Bearer token authentication. To authenticate:

1. **Register/Login**: Use `/api/auth/register` or `/api/auth/login` endpoints
2. **Get Token**: The login response includes an `access_token`
3. **Use Token**: Include in requests as `Authorization: Bearer <your-token>`

Example:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" http://localhost:8000/api/clients
```

## Deployment

### Current Production Setup
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from Git
- **Backend**: Deployed on Railway with managed PostgreSQL database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic backups and connection pooling
- **Environment**: Secrets managed via Railway dashboard, HTTPS enabled

### Local vs Production Architecture
- **Local Development**: SQLite database (automatic, no setup required)
